## Sup Topic Terminologies And Explanations

### Brute Force
* Is a general method that can be used to solve almost any algorithm problem, it's solving a problem by traversing the entire (or part of the) search space to obtainthe required solution. During the search, we are allowed to prune (that is, choose not to explore) parts of the search space if we have determined that these parts have no possibility of containing the required solution.
* **Speeding up brute-force searches** 
  * [Heuristic technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic)
#### When Use Brute Force
#### When Brute Force Fails
#### Brute Force Techniques
* **Pruning the search**
* **Meet in the middle**
### Brute Force Examples  
* **Memoization**
* **Generating subsets**
* **Generating permutations**
#### Iterative
* 
#### Recursive
- Function do some logic calls itself in(sub problem) until reaches a base case.
* **Backtracking** is a form of recursion in order to explore all the possibilities until you get the best result for the problem
### Greedy
* A greedy algorithm obtains an optimal solution to a problem by making a sequenceof choices. At each decision point, the algorithm makes choice that seems best at the moment. Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems but this strategy does not always produce an optimal solution
#### When Use Greedy
* At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment
* We get the optimal solution of the complete problem
#### When Greedy Fails
#### Greedy Techniques
#### Greedy Examples
* **[Interval scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_scheduling) AKA Activity-selection problem** Given n events with their starting and ending times, find a schedule that includes as many events as possible, and are compatible if the intervals _(si, fi)_ and _(sj, fj)_ do not overlap.
  * **How to solve** 
    * Always select the next possible event that ends as early as possible.
  * **Proof**
