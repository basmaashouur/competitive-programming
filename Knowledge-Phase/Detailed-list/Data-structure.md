## Sup Topic Terminologies and Explanations 


### Linear DS
-  Collection of variables that are of similar data types and it's elements form a linear sequence.

* **Static Array** is array which you can't change it's size once declared.
  * **1D Array** store single list of elements, can be distinctly accessed by specifying its index.
  * **2D Array || Matrix** multi-dimensional array is an array of arrays, for an array of size N×M, the rows and columns are numbered from 0 to N−1 and columns are numbered from 0 to M−1.
  * **ND Array**
  * **Memset** use it to initialize all elements of an integer array to 0 or -1 but not the other values.
