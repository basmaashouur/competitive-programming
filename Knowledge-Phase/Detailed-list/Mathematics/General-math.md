## Sup Topic Terminologies And Explanations

# Arithmetic
## High Precision Integers
- Representing truly enormous integers digits. by Arrays of Digits, (big int).
## High Precision Arithmetic
- Operations madde to the (big int) like (+, - , *, /)
## Numerical Bases and Conversion
## Real Numbers

# Algebra
## Sets And Numbers And Functions
### Definitions:
- **Sets** is an unordered collection of objects, called elements or members of the set. A set is said to contain its elements. We write a ∈ A to denote that a is an element of the set A. A set can contain no elements at all; this is the empty set 0 = {}. 
- **Set union** U (union) We define A UB to be the set each of whose elements is contained either in A or in B (or in both).
- **Set intersection**  n (intersection) We define A n B to be the set whose elements are contained in both A and B.
- **Subset** If all elements of a set A are contained in a set B, we say that A is a subset of B and write A ⊆ B. Note that A ⊆ A and 0 ⊆ A for all sets A.
- Two fundamental sets are the natural numbers N := {I, 2, 3,4, ... } and the integers Z := {O, ±1,±2,±3, ±4, ... }.
- **Set subtraction** A - B := {a ∈ A : a no∈ B}; 
- **Power Sets** the power set of S is the set of all subsets *all combinations of elements of a set* of the set S. The power set of S is denoted by P(S).
- **Function** A relation in which each input has only one output. Often denoted f(x).
- **Range** The set of all outputs of a relation or function.
- **Domain** The set of all inputs of a relation or function.

## Sequences And Summations And Product
- **Sequences** A sequence is a function from a subset of the set of integers (usually either the set{0, 1, 2,...} or the set {1, 2, 3,...}) to a set S.
- **Geometric progression** is a sequence of the form {a, ar, ar^2,... , ar^n,...} where the initial term a and the common ratio r are real numbers.
- **Arithmetic progression** is a sequence of the form {a, a + d, a + 2d,... ,a + nd, ...} where the initial term a and the common difference d are real numbers.
- **Recurrence relation** the sequence {an} is an equation that expresses an in terms of one or more of the previous terms of the sequence, namely, a0, a1,...,an−1, for all integers n with n ≥ n0, where n0 is a nonnegative integer.
   * **The initial conditions** for a recursively defined sequence specify the terms that precede the first term where the recurrence relation takes effect.
   * We say that we have solved the recurrence relation together with the initial conditions when we find an explicit formula, called a **closed formula**, for the terms of the sequence
- **The Fibonacci sequence** {f0, f1, f2,..., }is defined by the initial conditions f0 = 0, f1 = 1, and the recurrence relation fn = fn−1 + fn−2 for n = 2, 3, 4,....
- **Summations And Product Notation**
  * Σ (sigma) is used for sum and π (pi) is used for product.
## Polynomials
### Definition:
- **Polynomials** is a mathematical expression consisting of a sum of terms, each term including a variable or variables raised to a power and multiplied by a coefficient.
