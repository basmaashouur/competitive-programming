### Euclidean Geometry Foundations
* **Space**
  * **Definitions**
    * **Space** is a term used to describe an infinitely large area that spans in all directions forever, and is empty unless a scenario says otherwise.
    * **Euclidean space** itâ€™s basic units are points, which we can construct from it(lines, planes and shapes), as sets of points having prescribed properties it comes in dimensions from 1 to n.
