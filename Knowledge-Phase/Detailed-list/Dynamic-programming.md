## Sup Topic Terminologies And Explanations

## DP Intro
### Intro
- When we use DP
  - When we solve a recursive problem that its sub-problems overlaps, hence calling sub-problems More than once and repeating its calculation in nature that typically makes the order exponentials!
  - When the original space is small enough to be memorized, then saving these sub-problems makes order small too, as sub-problems calculated once.
  - Dynamic Programming most typical cases: Minimization, Maximization and Counting. But could have adhock usages.
- Search space
  - Is the number of recursive calls, or how many times we are branching every time.
- Rules of DP
  - Recursive Function
  - Sub-calls Overlap
  - Small Search Space, so putting in memory is doable
### Memoization
- It is a technique when we have a recurive function and save calls
- We use it when we have **Sparse Calls**
- It's a top down approach
### Tableuztion
- We use it whenw e have **Calls**
- It's a bottom up approach
