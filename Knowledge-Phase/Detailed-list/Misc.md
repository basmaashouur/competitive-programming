## Sup Topic Terminologies And Explanations
## Two Pointers
## Contiguous Subarray Sum
### Cumulative Sum
- AKA Prefix Sum Array, you will given an array you need to find the sum of the query [L,R]
  - First find the prefix sum, if we have (a1, a2, a3, ... N), then cm[0] = a1 and for cm[x] = ax + cm[x-1]
  - Now that is the sum from 0 to any cell in the array, to find the sum from any cell to any cell
  - Use **inclusive-exculsive principle**, so the sum from (L, R) = cm[R] - cm [L-1]
  - The same logic for 2D matrix to find a rectangle sum use cm[rx][ry] - cm[rx][ly - 1] - cm[lx - 1][ry] + cm[lx - 1][ly - 1]
### Partial Sum
- AKA Maximum Intersection, when you make a query in some range and add some value in all the indicies lay in that range, then you need to find the final value in some index.
   - we wanna add 4 from range (l,r) then arr[l] = 4, arr[r+1] = -4, then make Cumulative sum.

### Equal Sum
- Find how many sum that equals K
  - While calculating the prefix sum If the (prefix_sum - K) has found before, as prefix sum then K exist
  - Use HashMap and make map[prefixsum]++
### Closest Sum
- Find the max sum **closest sum** sub array and the sum less than or equal k
  - What you do is add the j-th value (right itr) to the current sum, and while the sum is larger than t, subtract the i-th value (left itr) and shift i one space forward. After each step is done, check whether the current interval size is larger than the maximum recorded so far and you're done.
### Max And Min Sum
- The problem is to find the sum of the elements (possibly some of the elements negative) of the contiguous subarray having the smallest(minimum sum) or the biggest (maxmum sum).
- We gonna use Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm it's a variant of Dynamic Programming
### Zero Sum
- Given an array of positive and negative numbers, find if there is a subarray (of size at-least one) with 0 sum
  - While calculating the prefix sum If the prefix sum has found before means there is subarray equal zero, means if 
  now prefix sum = a, and a exist before -> a+b = a means b = 0
  -  we can use hashing and add prefix sum to the mao and check if it's has found before.
### Equilibrium Index
- Equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes
  - make two vars one have all the value on the left and the other all the values on the right and always make bwteen them empty index, if n = 5
     - left = 1, right = 3, 4, 5
     - left = 1, 2, right = 4, 5
     - left = 1, 2, 3, right = 5
### Longest Increasing Subarray
