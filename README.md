### About
- This Repo contains different stuff related to problem solving on the whole and competitive programming in particular. 

### Art Of Problem Solving
* I splitted the Problem Solving into two phases:
  * Stydying Competitive Programming topics AKA [Knowledge Phase](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Knowledge-Phase) This Phase is about studying some topics and solving a straightforward problems that are applications on that topic.

### Study part
* Select the topic you want to study
* Search and find all the resources that you will study to cover everthing about this topic.
  * Make a [General List](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Knowledge-Phase/list.md) of all the topics (Toplogical sorting) and approximate time of finishing.
* Study and understand the sup-topics of that topic.
  * Make a [Detailed List](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Knowledge-Phase/Detailed-list) of sup topic's resources, keywords and explanations.
* Write a general code of that sup topic  **If exist** and put it in [Topics library](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Knowledge-Phase/Topics-library).

### Solving part
* Make a [Problems library](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Knowledge-Phase/Problems-library) for each of the topics, contains problems of that topic's sup topic.
* Identify all the sup topics in the problem
  * **Know all** the sup topics and already wrote it in ([Detailed List](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Knowledge-Phase/Detailed-list), [Topics library](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Knowledge-Phase/Topics-library)), go to the next step.
  * **Know most** the sup topics, write the missing in ([Detailed List](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Knowledge-Phase/Detailed-list), [Topics library](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Knowledge-Phase/Topics-library)), go to the next step.
  * **Know nothing** of the sup topics and can't solve it, put it in [to-solve](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Solutions-library/to-solve) and go to the **Study part**.
* [Solving techniques](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Solutions-library/Solving-techniques.md).
* Write the sloution in the [Sloutions library](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Solutions-library). 
  
  * Solving different problems without knowing it's topics AKA [Random Phase](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Random-Phase)
