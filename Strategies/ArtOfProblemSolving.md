- Do you keep comparing yourself with others?
- Do you have negative feelings? Like I am stupid..I am hopeless...I will never have a comparable level...?
- Do you think of your image/appearance if failed in online contests so avoid contests?
- Do you use another account with a weird name to train so that people don't know about your progress/failure?
- Do you wish your friends fail in the contest? or get annoyed with their better performance?
- Do you avoid teaching your friends something or give no support to remain better than them?
- Do you feel bored/frustrated as no/weak community in your college?
- Do you keep training day and night without breaks? No socialization at all?
- Do you hate specific topics and avoid them (probability/geometry)?
- ‘Should I stop’ Dilemma? Keep thinking is it worth vs a waste of time?
