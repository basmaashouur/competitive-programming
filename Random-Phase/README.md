### About
  - This phase is about solving random problems that you don't know which topic does it belong to, which level, and which tags. For example if you are a Div.2 beginner you should solve random problems on Div.2  not on Div.1, otherwise it would be a painful process. 
  
 
 ### How
 * Know the problems (Contest, Random.. etc)
  * [Solving Techniques](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Solutions-library/Solving-techniques.md)
* Make a [Problems library](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Knowledge-Phase/Problems-library) for each of the topics, contains problems of that topic's sup topic.
* Identify all the sup topics in the problem
  * **Know all** the sup topics and already wrote it in ([Detailed List](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Knowledge-Phase/Detailed-list), [Topics library](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Knowledge-Phase/Topics-library)), go to the next step.
  * **Know most** the sup topics, write the missing in ([Detailed List](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Knowledge-Phase/Detailed-list), [Topics library](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Knowledge-Phase/Topics-library)), go to the next step.
  * **Know nothing** of the sup topics and can't solve it, put it in [to-solve](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Solutions-library/to-solve) and go to the **Study part**.
* [Solving techniques](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Solutions-library/Solving-techniques.md).
* Write the sloution in the [Sloutions library](https://github.com/basmaashouur/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/Solutions-library).
